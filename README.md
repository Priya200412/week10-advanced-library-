## Advanced Python Concepts Project

This project demonstrates important advanced Python features in a single runnable program.

Concepts Included:
• Decorators – retry, cache, timer
• Generators – fibonacci and batch processing
• Context Manager – automatic file handling
• Metaclass – plugin registration system
• Testing – simple validation using assert

🎯 Learning
- Enhance functions using decorators
- Memory-efficient iteration with generators
- Safe resource handling with context managers
- Class auto-registration using metaclasses
- Importance of testing

✅ Conclusion
A simple demonstration of how real Python frameworks use advanced language features internally.
